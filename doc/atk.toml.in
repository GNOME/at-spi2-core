framework. This framework defines a set of interfaces to which
graphical interface components adhere. This allows, for instance,
screen readers to read the text of an interface and interact with its
controls. ATK support is built into GTK+ 3 and the rest of the GNOME
platform, so any application using GTK+ 3 will have reasonable
accessibility support for free.
GTK4 now includes accessibility support natively and does not need ATK."""
