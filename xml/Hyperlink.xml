      org.a11y.atspi.Hyperlink:
      @short_description: Interfacing for interacting with linked content.

      Objects implementing org.a11y.Atspi.Hyperlink are returned by objects
      that implment org.a11y.Atspi.Hypertext and are the means by which
      end users and clients interact with linked, and in some cases
      embedded, content. These instances may have multiple "anchors", where
      an anchor corresponds to a reference to a particular resource with a
      corresponding resource identified (URI).

        Version: The version of this interface.

        NAnchors: The total number of anchors that this hyperlink has.

        Though typical hyperlinks have only one anchor, client-side image
        maps and other hypertext objects may potentially activate or refer
        to multiple URIs.  For each anchor there is a corresponding URI and
        object.

        See also GetURI and GetObject.
