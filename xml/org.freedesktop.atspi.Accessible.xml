<interface name="org.freedesktop.atspi.Accessible">
  <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>The base interface which is implemented by all accessible objects. 
      All objects support interfaces for querying their contained 'children' 
      and position in the accessible-object hierarchy, whether or not they
      actually have children.  </p>

    <p>Events that may be emitted by instances of Accessible include:
      "object:property-change" A base (strongly-typed) object attribute has changed,
      for instance "object:property-change:accessible-name".
      Notifed property subtypes include accessible-name, accessible-description,
      accessible-parent and accessible-role.</p>

    <p>"object:children-changed" The number or identity of an object's children
      has changed.
      
      "object:state-changed" The object's StateSet has had a state added
      or removed.
      
      "object:active-descendant-changed" If the object includes 
      STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS, this event is fired to indicate that the 
      descendant having STATE_ACTIVE has changed; this corresponds to
      "micro" keyboard focus when the containing/emitting object has
      "macro" or technical keyboard focus.  For instance, this event is
      usually emitted while traversing tables and/or spreadsheet cells.
      
      "object:attribute-change" A weakly-typed property, as contained in the
      AttributeSet returned by Accessible::getAttributes, has changed in value,
      been added, or been removed from the object.
      ("object:attribute-change" notifications were added in AT-SPI 1.7.0)</p>

  <method name="getAttributes">
    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Get a list of properties applied to this object as a whole, as an 
        AttributeSet consisting of name-value pairs. As such these attributes
        may be considered weakly-typed properties or annotations, as distinct
        from the strongly-typed interface instance data declared using the IDL 
        "attribute" keyword.</p>

      <p>Not all objects have explicit "name-value pair" AttributeSet properties.      </p>

      <p>Attribute names and values may have any UTF-8 string value, however where possible,
        in order to facilitate consistent use and exposure of "attribute" properties by
        applications and AT clients, attribute names and values should chosen from  
        a publicly-specified namespace where appropriate.</p>

      <p>Where possible, the names and values in the name-value pairs
        should be chosen from well-established attribute namespaces
        using standard semantics.       
        For example, attributes of Accessible objects corresponding to XHTML content 
        elements should correspond to attribute names and values specified in the w3c 
        XHTML specification, at http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2, where such values are not 
        already exposed via a more strongly-typed aspect of the AT-SPI API.
        Metadata names and
        values should be chosen from the 'Dublin Core' Metadata
        namespace using Dublin Core semantics:
        http://dublincore.org/dcregistry/
        Similarly, relevant structural metadata should be exposed
        using attribute names and values chosen from the CSS2 and WICD specification:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512
        WICD (http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-WICD-20051121/).    </p>

      <p>Clients seeking semantic or typographical attributes associated with
        specific character spans of text content should use Text.getAttributeRun instead.
        The attributes returned by Accessible.getAttributes do not include
        "text attributes". (See Text.getAttributeRun)</p>

    <arg direction="out" type="as" tp:type="AttributeSet">
    <tp:docstring>
