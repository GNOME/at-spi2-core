* Default to --enable-relocate for now.

* Fix for FDO#29880: gtk module can't handle reloading.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.90:

* FDO#29365: Stop using a deprecated glib function.

* Caching fixes--GetItems was completely broken in v0.3.6, and fixed a
possible crash when it is called.

* Only emit signals when AT-SPI clients are listening for them.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.6:

* Fixed a problem with dbus introspection.

* Do not block waiting for a response when registering.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.5:

* Have a socket retrieve its state set from its embedded plug

* Rename AT_SPI_CLIENT to AT_SPI_REENTER_G_MAIN_LOOP, but still check the
former variable as well for now.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.4:

* Ref an object while adding it to the message generated by GetItems.
This prevents a crash if all other references to the objects go away while
it is being analyzed.

* Add GetChildren to the introspection.

* Fix NSelectedRows and NSelectedColumns.

* Fix the behavior of ChildCount and GetChildAtIndex for sockets with
embedded plugs.

* Fix extra unref when calling get_row_header or get_column_header on a
table, or calling atk_hyperlink_get_object.

* Set the /desktop/gnome/interface/at-spi-dbus gconf key to false by default
(this key is only used when at-spi2 is relocated, which it is not by default).

* Fix a few compiler warnings.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.3:

* Remove unused gtk build dependency.

* Install a copy of the module into the gtk-3.0 modules directory.

tracebacks when handling Firefox events.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.2:

* Cache additions are now done in an idle call.  This prevents additions
from being made when an object may not be fully initialized and prevents

corresponding AtkPlug.

* An application is no longer registered if its root is an AtkPlug.

* Fix FDO#27626 - deadlock when registering an application.

* Fix a problem with various hyperlink methods.

* Fix for an AtkPlug sometimes not appearing in the hierarchy.

* Fix a crash if the registry returns an unexpected message while embedding.

* Remove libxml2 dependency since libxml2 is no longer used.

* Fix handling of MATCH_ANY for a stateset in a collection match rule.

* Disabled relocation by default.
