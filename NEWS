  order to keep caches synchronized.

  by an application.

* FIxed BGO#563546: Removed the g_atexit hook.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 1.91.1:

    * Fire all events until we receive a reply from GetRegisteredEvents

What's new in at-spi2-atk 1.91.0:

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.5:

* Have a socket retrieve its state set from its embedded plug

* Rename AT_SPI_CLIENT to AT_SPI_REENTER_G_MAIN_LOOP, but still check the
former variable as well for now.

What's new in at-spi2-atk 0.3.4:

* Ref an object while adding it to the message generated by GetItems.

embedded plugs.

* Fix extra unref when calling get_row_header or get_column_header on a
table, or calling atk_hyperlink_get_object.
