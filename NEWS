What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.4:

* Added GetChildren to the spec.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.3:

* Add return values to some functions that were missing them.

* Make DeviceEventListener notifiers reentrant so that an application can
query the desktop object while processing a device event.

* Fix for FDO#28300: fails to link with pedantic linkers.

* Fix crash if GetChildAtIndex is called with an invalid index.

What's new in at-spi2-core 0.3.2:

* Make sure that disconnecting applications send their root path in the
remove applications signal. This was causing applications to not be
removed from the desktop properly.

* Set an application's Id when registering it.

* Disabled relocation by default.
