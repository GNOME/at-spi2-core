# Accessibility infrastructure

This repository contains the [DBus][DBus] interface definitions for
AT-SPI (Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface) â€” the core of
an accessibility stack for free software systems.  It also contains
the basic daemons of the accessibility stack, the ATK library to make
applications and GUI toolkits accessible, and the internal hooks
between AT-SPI and ATK.

The version control repository and bug tracker are at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/at-spi2-core/

You can visit an ever-changing roadmap in [`devel-docs/roadmap.md`](devel-docs/roadmap.md).

To write accessible applications, look into `atk` or your
programming language's bindings for the `xml` DBus interfaces
mentioned below.

While this module started within the [GNOME][GNOME] project's umbrella, it is not used
only in GNOME.  Other sources of relevant information about AT-SPI and Accessibility
include:

* [GNOME Accessibility wiki][gnome-a11y-wiki]
* [KDE Accessibility wiki][kde-a11y-wiki]
* [Accessibility documentation for GNOME users][docs-users]

## Documentation

* [ATK reference documentation][atk-docs]
* [libatspi reference documentation][libatspi-docs]

## Development resources

* [Code coverage report for the test suite][coverage]
* [Container registry for CI images][registry]
* [Continuous integration pipelines][pipelines]
* [Development documentation](devel-docs/)

## Summary of this repository's contents

* `xml` - DBus interfaces for accessibility, described in DBus's XML introspection format.
  Ideally, your programming language's implementation of DBus makes use of these files to
  generate callable bindings.
  
* `bus` - Launcher for the session's accessibility bus; see its [README.md](bus/README.md)
  for details.

* `registryd` - Daemon that keeps track of accessible applications in the user's session,
  and lets them talk to each other and to assistive technologies (ATs) like screen
  readers.

* `atk` - GObject-based API to implement accessible applications and
  GUI toolkits.  It is not mandatory to use this library for an
  accessible application; your application or toolkit can use bindings to the
  `xml` DBus APIs directly.
  
* `atspi` - Hand-written binding for the `xml` DBus interface above, for use from C with
  [GObject][GObject].  This is not normally what you would use; use a language-specific
  binding instead.  This module is for use mainly by `atk-adaptor` below.
  
* `atk-adaptor` - Translates from the ATK API to the atspi API.
  Application programmers can ignore this and just consider it as an
  implementation detail.

* `dbind` - DBus utilities for use by `atspi` above.  `atspi` was written before the more
  modern C bindings like [GDBusConnection][GDBus] were available, so there is a lot of
  hand-written IPC here.
  
* `droute` - DBus utilities for use by `atk-adaptor` above.

* Documentation for the Gitlab [Continuous Integration pipeline](devel-docs/gitlab-ci.md).

## Historical note

Versions 1.x of AT-SPI were based on [CORBA][CORBA] for inter-process communication (IPC),
using GNOME's ORBit implementation thereof.  During the GNOME 2 and 3 release series,
CORBA was phased out in favor of [DBus][DBus], a more modern IPC mechanism.

The original CORBA interfaces for AT-SPI were based on Java's implementation of
accessibility.  Later, these CORBA interfaces were translated to DBus.  This is why the
interfaces sometimes have a 1990s feeling to them.

The project was started with a D-Bus performance review, the results of which are available
on the GNOME wiki. Keep in mind that the D-Bus AT-SPI design documents on this page have
not been kept up to date.
