Welcome to the developer's guide for the freedesktop accessibility
infrastructure.  This guide intends to become a repository of
knowledge on the implementation of the accessibility infrastructure,
as well as a guide for application developers and toolkit developers
who want to make their user interfaces accessible.

If you want to modify this document, `please see its source code
