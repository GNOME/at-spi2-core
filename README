ATK - The Accessibility Toolkit
===============================

For more information about ATK and accessibility in GNOME, see:

  https://wiki.gnome.org/Accessibility

Dependencies
------------

ATK requires GLib >= 2.32. Information about GLib is available from:

  https://www.gtk.org

Getting the source code
-----------------------

You can get the source code of each ATK release as a tarball:

  https://download.gnome.org/sources/atk/

You can also clone the ATK master branch from GNOME repository:

  https://git.gnome.org/browse/atk

Building
--------

To buid ATK from a release tarball you can use Autotools:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Alternatively, you can use Meson and Ninja:

    $ meson _build .
    $ ninja -C _build
    # ninja -C _build install

To build ATK from a Git clone using Autotools, run the autogen.sh script
instead of the configure one; before running autogen.sh or configure, make
sure you have libtool in your path. If you use Meson, no changes are
necessary.

Note that autogen.sh runs the configure script for you. If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options to
autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure; if you wish to run
autogen.sh without running the configure script, export the NOCONFIGURE
environment variable.

How to report bugs
------------------

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system:

You will need to create an account for yourself.

You can also mail the mailing list gnome-accessibility-devel@gnome.org
